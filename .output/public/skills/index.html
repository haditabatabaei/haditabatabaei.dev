I focus on building SEO-friendly and accessible web applications that adhere to best practices, WAI-ARIA rules, and related attributes. I ensure the correct usage of HTML outline and semantic tags like picture and headings. <br> Furthermore, I possess a deep understanding of CSS concepts and features, including BoxModel, Block Formatting Context (BFC), and various selectors. I utilize Flexbox in almost any scenario. <!--]--></p><h2 class="kit-typography kit-typography__description skills__title"><!--[--> Typescript <!--]--></h2><p class="kit-typography kit-typography__text"><!--[--> Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of Typescript due to various reasons. In most cases, writing clean Javascript is more readable and maintainable, especially for front-end web applications. <br> However, I have some limited working experience with Typescript in some of my projects, and my knowledge here is relatively shallow. Although I&#39;m not a fan of Typescript, I respect companies and other developers&#39; opinions, and I can familiarize myself with Typescript projects in no time. <!--]--></p><h2 class="kit-typography kit-typography__description skills__title"><!--[--> React, Next.js <!--]--></h2><p class="kit-typography kit-typography__text"><!--[--> I have participated in developing and maintaining a large-scale React-based web application for the past 2 years, with React, Redux, and relative toolchain. I possess a relatively deep knowledge of what React does behind the scenes and understand its concepts and caveats. During my time at Divar, I reviewed a lot of codes, and I am familiar with common pitfalls and anti-patterns involved in developing and designing components. We also built a lot of abstractions over currently available public APIs as an answer to our needs. <br> Additionally, at Divar, we developed our own SSR implementation with Express.js and did various optimizations. I have experience developing and maintaining a UI component library with React and Storybook as a separate non-monorepo project. I also developed a JavaScript script that checks for the latest releases and updates our root project accordingly. <br> Although I have very limited experience with Next.js in some of my projects as contracts, I can jump into a Next.js project with minimal buffer time. <!--]--></p><h2 class="kit-typography kit-typography__description skills__title"><!--[--> Vue, Nuxt <!--]--></h2><p class="kit-typography kit-typography__text"><!--[--> Vue was my first choice a couple of years ago when I decided to jump onto a framework. Since then, I have developed many small and personal projects with Vue that are available on my <a class="skills__link" href="https://github.com/haditabatabaei/" target="_blank">Github Profile</a>. <br> When I was working at Sneeds and later AbroadIn, I developed a web application from scratch using Vue.js version 2 (which was the latest release at the time). I possess a deep understanding of the concepts of reactivity in Vue and the differences with React, lifecycles, and etc. <br> Additionally, we started building a UI library with Vue at the time, although unfortunately, I left later. <!--]--></p><h2 class="kit-typography kit-typography__description skills__title"><!--[--> Webpack and relative toolchain <!--]--></h2><p class="kit-typography kit-typography__text"><!--[--> I possess a deep understanding of what Webpack does and can even configure it from scratch (with the help of its documentation, of course). When it comes to Webpack, I know what I am doing. I can add a new plugin or edit and update existing ones. Additionally, I can create separate builds with Webpack for various use cases like staging, development, etc. <br> I also built a very simple static site generator with page folder routing using Webpack and Handlebars. <!--]--></p><h2 class="kit-typography kit-typography__description skills__title"><!--[--> DevOps, Docker, K8S and ... <!--]--></h2><p class="kit-typography kit-typography__text"><!--[--> I have limited experience working with Kubernetes, specifically working with pods, monitoring, and creating and deploying service and ingress. Additionally, I possess limited academic experience with containers and their internal concepts. However, I can configure CI/CD pipelines in GitLab and can perform various automations. <!--]--></p></div><!--]--></main><!--]--><!--]--><!--[--><!----><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@48,400,0,0"><!--]--></section><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/skills/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1680112208448})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.69a575ea.js" crossorigin></script></body>
